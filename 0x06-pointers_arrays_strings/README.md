:four: 4-rev_array.c reverses the content of an array of integers

:five: 5-string_toupper.c changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase

- Letters ***t*** and ***T*** should be replaced by ***7***
- Letters ***l*** and ***L*** should be replaced by ***1***
```

## ADVANCED ↗️

:one::zero::zero: 100-rot13.c encodes a string using rot13

:one::zero::one: 101-print_number.c displays integers (use of `printf` forbidden)

:one::zero::two: 102-magic.c is `the 19th line of code` in existant code where `a[2]=98` following the requirements
```
- Use of a forbidden
- Forbidden to modify the variable p
- Only one statement
