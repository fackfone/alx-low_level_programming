# WHAT THE PROGRAMS DO :octocat:

:zero: 0-reset_to_98.c takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates its value to 98 

:one: 1-swap.c swaps the values of two integers

:two: 2-strlen.c returns the length of a string

:three: 3-puts.c prints a string, followded by a new line, to `stdout`

:four: 4-print_rev.c orints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line

:five: 5-rev_string.c reverses a string

:six: 6-puts2.c prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line

:seven: 7-puts_half.c prints half of a string, followed by a new line

:eight: 8-print_array.c prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line

:nine: 9-strcpy.c copies a string pointed to by `src` , including the terminating null byte `(\0)`, to the buffer pointed by `dest`

:one::zero::zero: 100-atoi.c converts a string to an integer

:one::zero::one: 101-print_number.c displays integers (use of `printf` forbidden)
