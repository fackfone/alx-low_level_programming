Hello everyone
How are you doing
My name is Donfack Fone Evans Lindel
A cameroonian guy living in Douala
I am a civil engineer with a bachelor of technology
in Civil Engineering
I intended to pursue my education abroad precisely
in Germany but some unpredictable issues occured 
during the process and my uncle who was willing
to take at least 80% of the fees have got fired
during the COvid19 Pandemic and can't work 
since March2020, so regarding the situation
I just never give up because I always tell to
myself that it can also be a case during my 
journey so I am doing all possible to have a better
life in Cameroon, because yeah it's possible, one of
the best example is Dr Claudel Noubissie.
So actually I observe that I'm found of technology
I really appreciate the way to work with computers
and create digital services to others, I definitely
love that, when I was online on FB I saw an 
advert about ALX which is a high-recognized institute of
leaders by Founder Fred Swaniker and they was offering a 
full 12-month program in Software Engineering partnered
with HOLBERTON, at this moment I was like, woow this is really
an opportunity to grasp and shift my future skills not only
to Cameroonians but to the entire world, so actually I'm crafting
my skills to become a better Software Engineer (even though sometimes
I might feel daunted about the projects);
So my main goal is to start the year January 2022 with activities related
to web development first online where I can show what I've learned
